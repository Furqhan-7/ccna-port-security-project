# Port Security Configuration on a Cisco Switch in Cisco Packet Tracer  

## Project Overview  
A simple CCNA project to demonstrate **Port Security** on a Cisco switch using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The goal is to restrict access to a switch port and allow only authorized devices.  

## Devices Used  
- 1 Switch  
- 2 PCs  

## Steps  
1. Connect PCs to the switch.  
2. Configure a switch port with port security.  
3. Set the maximum number of allowed MAC addresses (e.g., 1).  
4. Assign a static MAC address or let the switch learn dynamically.  
5. Test by connecting an unauthorized PC to the port.  

## Result  
- The authorized PC can connect successfully.  
- The unauthorized PC is blocked when connected to the secured port.
